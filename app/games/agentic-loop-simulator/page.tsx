          The single most important control in the simulator is the &quot;separate judge agent&quot;
          toggle. With it on, a second agent reviews the work against the spec and catches a status
          code the builder got wrong. Turn it off and the builder grades its own work, sees green tests,
          and stops, shipping a confident bug. That is the whole reason serious agent loops split the
          agent that writes the code from the agent that checks it.

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-sm font-semibold">How this maps to Claude Code</h4>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Plan and Judge are the kind of work you hand to a subagent, often a different model, so the
          judge is not grading its own homework. Build is the main agent using the Read, Edit, and Bash
          tools. The loop runs until a goal condition or a turn limit, the same way a real harness keeps
          an agent going until the work is actually done.
