          Both triage errors are expensive, in opposite directions. Suppress a soft bounce and you
          permanently drop a real subscriber because their mailbox was briefly full. Retry a hard bounce
          and you damage your sending reputation every single time, because mailbox providers read
          repeated delivery to a known-dead address as a sign you are working from a purchased list.
          The 5xx responses that are really about content or rate are where most people go wrong: the 5
          looks permanent, so they get filed with the dead addresses and a fixable template problem
          turns into a shrinking list.

        <h4 className="mb-2 text-sm font-semibold">Doing this automatically in production</h4>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Nobody triages bounces by hand at volume. In production your provider posts a webhook for each
          bounce and complaint, and your handler classifies it and writes to a suppression list that the
          next send checks before it queues anything. The part worth caring about when you choose a
          provider is whether you get the receiving server&apos;s actual response, like the ones in this
          simulator, or just a category label. &quot;Bounced&quot; is not enough to act on:{' '}
          <span className="font-mono text-xs">550 5.1.1 user unknown</span> and{' '}
          <span className="font-mono text-xs">550 5.7.1 content rejected</span> are the same category
          and need opposite responses.{' '}

          keeps the full diagnostic next to the message that caused it, and suppression is enforced on
          send rather than being advisory.
